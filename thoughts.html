          <h3>My Co-op Experience at AtriCure: From Data Pipelines to Documentation</h3>

            Working as an Application and Data Analyst at AtriCure has been an incredible learning experience. 
            Over the past year, I've had the opportunity to work with Azure ETL data pipelines, PowerApps, 
            and PowerBI, while also maintaining extensive project documentation for cross-functional teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most valuable lessons I learned was the importance of clear documentation. When you're 
            working with 13+ data pipelines and multiple team members, having well-organized documentation 
            isn't just helpful, it's essential. Through this role, I developed skills in data integration, 
            business intelligence, and technical communication that will serve me throughout my career.

            When Milk Jar Franchise approached me to help visualize their sales data, I knew this would be 
            a great opportunity to apply my data analytics skills to a real-world business problem. Learning how to use 
            PowerBI through self-teaching, I managed to create a simple interactive dashboard that helped them understand their sales patterns 
            and make data-driven decisions about inventory and staffing.

            Creating 40+ prototypes in Figma taught me that great design is about iteration. 
            Each round of feedback brought us closer to a solution that truly served the students. 
            This project showed me the importance of user research and the value of listening to 
            the people who will actually use your product.
            Even though the project never launched, the experience was invaluable in shaping my approach to UX design.

            At STEAM For Vietnam, I had the opportunity to become a TA for an introductory programming course in Robotics and Python programming for over 200 students.
            This experience taught me the importance of patience, clear communication, and adaptability. I learned how to explain complex concepts in simple terms and to be responsive to the diverse needs of students.
